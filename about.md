Hello,

I'm just a simple anonymity and privacy activist. Pota...Sorry...This project is my passion.

I strongly believe privacy should be a universal right and that anonymity should never become illegal. I don't want our lives to turn into Gattaca, Minority Report, Black Mirror, or 1984 (Too late for that one, I'm afraid). I do not want our laws and rights to become terms of services.

My goal is to bring accessible knowledge on these topics to the many and hopefully reach the few good people who really need it. In this specific case, I think the needs of the few outweigh the needs of the many.

Some facts about me:
- This might surprise you but I'm a woman. We exist in tech.
- I am not rich.
- I enjoy good memes, movies, series, and books (and I'm sure some of you will spot some of the many references to those in my project).
- I am probably not where you think I might be.
- I am probably not who you think I might be?
- I cannot confirm nor deny anything I wrote here is true.

Please share this project if you enjoy it and think it might be useful to others.
